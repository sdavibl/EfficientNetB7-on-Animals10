This project utilizes EfficientNetB7, a high-performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify animals in images with an impressive 95% accuracy. EfficientNetB7 optimizes accuracy and efficiency by leveraging compound scaling, adjusting depth, width, and resolution to enhance feature extraction. The model is trained on a diverse dataset, learning intricate patterns that differentiate various species. By employing transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, the system achieves high precision while maintaining computational efficiency. This project highlights the practical application of deep learning in image classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of modern CNN architectures in real-world scenarios.
